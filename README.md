## What I've learned

- HOC allow us to write a shorter code and more reuseable in term of put component in another component that provide a repetitive function or ui elements.
- Compound Components-provide access with contextAPI that build some advantage to reuse the components and give more flexibility. More easy to impove and maintainance. 
- React query-a good tool to handle fetching data 
- Supabase-first time SQL database which is provide any data in the projects, manage APIs, RLS(Row-Level Security) security and authentication 
- React Hook Form to handle form validations and more useful for requesting APIs
- Dark mode-I lacked some experience with CSS so this is first time I learned about converting colors in whole applications and more about preparation in CSS styled sheets
